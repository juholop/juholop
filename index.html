            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm an aspiring finnish software developer. My main occupation is in family medicine and I graduated as an MD
                from University of Tampere in 2019. I started learning to code in 2022 with <a href="https://www.codecamedy.com">
                Codecademy</a> course. My goal is to progress through the Web Development Course during 2022. I hope I'll be able
                to connect my knowledge of family medicine with web development in the future. I will be updating my projects and
                progress to this site through Github during 2022.
